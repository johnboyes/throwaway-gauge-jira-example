# Updating dependencies

## Dependabot

We use [GitHub Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically)
([bought by GitHub in 2019](https://dependabot.com/blog/hello-github/) and now
[baked into GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/))
to manage our dependencies.

Whenever possible we let Dependabot update our dependencies automatically (by
[automatically creating a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates#about-github-dependabot-pull-requests)
for us to merge).

Dependabot automatically updates our:

- [GitHub Actions (non-Docker dependencies only, for now)](https://github.blog/2020-06-25-dependabot-now-updates-your-actions-workflows/)

## Ubuntu version

[Ubuntu releases annually in April](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).  In 2020 the GitHub Actions team
[supported the new version by mid June](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/228#issuecomment-644065532),
so we have [an issue automatically created on for 15th July each year](https://github.com/agilepathway/agilepathway-template/pull/12)
to prompt us to update.
